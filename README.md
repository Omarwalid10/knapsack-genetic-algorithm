# knapsack-genetic-algorithm
this is a knapsack problem solved by a genetic algorithm Using rank selection, one-point crossover, and elitism replacement 

## Introduction 
The knapsack problem is a very well-known
optimization problem. Given a knapsack that can
carry weights up to a certain amount, and a number
of items; each item has a weight and a value, we
want to select the items to carry in the knapsack in
order to maximize the total value.
